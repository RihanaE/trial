                <p>The word museum usually brings to mind old, boring antiques locked away inside dull glass cases. Visitors have to walk around in complete silence without touching anything. York Castle Museum, on the other hand, aims to challenge the stereotype. And this starts straight away when you realize that the museum is housed inside an old prism. After you walk inside, you'll soon see the other differences. Here, entire rooms are made into giant displays, so visitors actually feel like they've stepped back in time. </p>
                
                <p>The main display is a recreated Victorian street called Kirkgate, which is named after the museum's founder, Dr. John Kirk. The street is eerily realistic, with its cobbled stones, family homes and curious shops. And if you get into any sort of trouble, there is even an old police station. Everything is done to a very high standard, and with the addition of various sound and lighting effects, the whole atmosphere is really brought to life. Other displays include an 1850s cottage and several different examples of everyday living and dining rooms from throughout history. This includes recent history in the 20th century, so it's possible to chart the progression of family life from many generations ago all the way up to the present day. </p>

                <p>Similarly, a gallery has recently recently been opened called the 60s, which takes a look at the music and fashion of that swinging decade. It's unusual for a museum to focus on a time period so recent, but it is a decision which has proved to be very popular among visitors. Of course. It's also fun to look back at some of the dramatic events in history, and the museum manages this by paying tribute to its past as a jail. Dick Turpin, the north's most famous highwayman, was imprisoned here in the 17 hundreds, and his cell is also recreated to look as it did back then. From this small room, turfin was led to the hanging block and executed for his life as a criminal. York Castle Museum is one of the best museums in the city and has gained a well deserved acclaim for its fun and modern approach to telling the stories of the past. </p>

                <p>Land's End is the westernmost point on the English mainland and one of the country's most famous landmarks, you can stand at it said and gave out at lantic Ocean with nothing but water separating you and America it's interesting to note that this isn't actually the most westerly place in Great Britain Scotland 35km further West it's also possible to go further South at Lizard Point just a short distance to the Southeast land is the point that has become known as the traditional last point of England and it's famous sign has been photographed thousands of times the sign can be altered to proclaim the answers to several famous places in fact to wherever you have come from New York for example is 3147 miles away. </p>

                <p>In the opposite direction the sign points to John O'Groats which is the northernmost settlement in Scotland the distance from Lands End to John O'Groats is 874 miles and this has become the accepted route for many different races and charity events when brave people attempt to travel the entire length of Great Britain by bicycle usually takes around a fortnight Walkers can often take several months although the record stands at just 9 Days many people have attempted the Challenge by using a variety of different methods such as buy skateboard by wheelchair and 5 plus PASS one person even managed to complete the walk naked people who have successfully finished the challenge become known as end-⁠to-⁠end us. </p>

                <p>The scenery at Land's End itself. Is mostly desolate rocks and star Cliffs it's appropriately dramatic but for a little more cheeriness and a little more colour. There is a nearby theme park which of the majority of the areas tourists the park contains a multitude of wildly different activities including a petting zoo a display of Doctor Who memorabilia informative exhibit based on the television show there are also several shops, which mostly sells souvenirs and locally sourced foods corner from Land's End Sennen Cove the village here is home to less than 200 people. </p>

                <p>
                    This tiny settlement received visitors from all over the country the reason for this is it speech which has attained a European Blue Flag award for cleanliness particularly well regarded within Britain surfing community to flock here to catch the waves the bay is protected from strong winds and swell make the perfect conditions unfortunate chance you get into trouble while you're out in the water then don't worry because Sennen Cove is a belief protected by Britain's first ever canine lifeguard the dog has been working here since 2005 rescuing swimmers and raising awareness about beach safety during the popular destination for any tourists in the area in the past many of them probably just took a photograph next to the sign and then went home but today. Enough the traction is here to make this trip last a lot longer than 5 minutes.

We Scots have remained fiercely proud of our country. </p>

                    <p>culture and achievements of history began in the first century and from then the nation has seen countless skirmishers battles and was against for such as the Romans especially the English and each other around the 9th century the spread of Christianity cause enough Alliance how long to Scottish people to lead to the first king Kenneth macalpin put a union with England didn't happen until the 17th century when Scotland's King James and Harry stone in London Between the Two Nations which continues to this day as part of the United Kingdom however, if you do get a chance to go to Scotland England football match may be best not to mention about the Union in any case, Scotland </p>
